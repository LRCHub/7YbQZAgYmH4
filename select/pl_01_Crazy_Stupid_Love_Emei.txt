Get out of my mind
I've been runnin' through
these red lights for green eyes
I know I should think twice
But pretty boys who love
to make me cry
Are my type
What's the worst
that could happen (Ah)
If you stay a little while,
while?
Don't mean to be dramatic
But I know how it goes (First)
You drive me crazy,
so crazy I go stupid
So stupid I'm in love,
that crazy stupid love
(Then) You call me "baby",
it hits me like it's Cupid
Now I can't get enough,
that crazy stupid love
That crazy stupid love
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, love
La-la, la-la
Love, love, love
That crazy, that stupid
That hula hoop, I jump through
it
One taste, one look
You reel me in like I'm hooked
I'm hooked on
all your pheromones
Hold on to the bed posts
Switchin' up the tempo,
t-t-t-t-tempo
Don't mean to be dramatic (Oh)
But I know how it goes (First)
You drive me crazy,
so crazy I go stupid
So stupid I'm in love,
that crazy stupid love (Love)
(Then) You call me "baby",
it hits me like it's Cupid
Now I can't get enough,
that crazy stupid love
That crazy stupid love
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, love
La-la, la-la
That crazy stupid love
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, love
La-la, la-la
(Crazy) I never thought
that I'd be the one to fall
(Crazy) But now
I'm trippin' waitin'
for you to call
(Crazy) I can't get enough,
is it even love if you don't?
You drive me crazy, so crazy
I go stupid
So stupid I'm in love,
that crazy stupid love
(Ah-ah-ah)
You call me "baby",
it hits me like it's Cupid
Now I can't get enough,
that crazy stupid love
That crazy stupid love
La-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, love
La-la, la-la
That crazy stupid love
La-la, la-la
La-a-a-a-a, love
La-la, la-la
Love, love, love
